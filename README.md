## How to get the dependencies for this project
### Install ABIDES
From inside the root folder (the one containing this readme) just run `setup.sh` or the following lines on your terminal in case `setup.sh` would not collaborate (e.g. you're using Windows):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abides-sim/abides.git
cd abides
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
```
This will create a new folder `abides` into this folder. And that's it, you're ready to go!
